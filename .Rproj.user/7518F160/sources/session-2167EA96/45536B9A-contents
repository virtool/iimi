## Introduction

This vignette aims to give an introduction on how to use the `iimi` package to 
do plant virus diagnostics and how to visualize the coverage profile for the 
sample mapping.

First, we will load necessary packages before we start any analysis.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(iimi)

library(Biostrings)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("C:/Users/dsain/Desktop/CLEANSED/DataWrangling/RData/truth.rda")
```

Note that we need sample mapping results to get started creating coverage 
profiles and feature-extracted data frame. We used Bowtie 2 to map the samples 
against the official Virtool virus data base. You can choose from Bowtie 2 or 
minimap2 since we have tried both and they yield similar result. We let both 
software to report all alignments (`-a` mode for Bowtie 2, `--secondary=yes` for 
minimap2).

## Converting BAM file(s) into coverage profiles and feature-extracted data frame

First, we convert the BAM file(s) into coverage profiles and feature-extracted data frame.

We will use the coverage profiles to visualize the mapping information. The
feature-extracted data frame will be used in the model training and testing 
process.

Note that both training and testing data need to go through the conversion step. 
In our example, we stored the conversion for both the testing and training 
datasets in the same object. You can do the conversion separately for your data.

**Note: the example code does not work unless you put in your own path**

1. State the path to the folder of your BAM files

   ```{r, warning=FALSE}
   path_to_bamfiles <- list.files(
     path = "C:/Users/dsain/Desktop/CLEANSED/test_bam",
     pattern = "bam$", full.names = TRUE, 
     include.dirs = TRUE
   )
   ```

2. Create a dataframe that contain the coverage profiles.

   1. If you have BAM files, convert them to a coverage profile data frame.

      ```{r, warning=FALSE}
      toy_data <- convert_bam_to_cov(bam_file = path_to_bamfiles)

      # we will get a list of coverage profiles and a data frame
      cov_info <- toy_data$cov

      df <- toy_data$ML_df
      head(df)
      ```

   2. If you have coverage profiles in RLE format, convert them to a coverage 
   profile data frame.

      ```{r, eval=FALSE}
      toy_data_2 <- convert_bam_to_cov(covs)

      cov_info_2 <- toy_data_2$cov

      df_2 <- toy_data_2$ML_df
      # head(df_2)
      ```

## Visualization

Next, we can visualize the coverage profile by using the `plot_cov()` function.

* `plot_cov()`: plots the coverage profile of the plant sample and the percentage
  of A nucleotides and GC content for a sliding window of k-mer with the step as 
  1. We used the default setting of k = 75.

  ```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
  covs_selected = list()
  covs_selected$`16GVP045_1` <- cov_info$`16GVP045_1`[c("4c559wtw", "z7cwn9ai", "7kb0l74n", "5948de0x")]

  par(mar = c(1,2,1,1))
  layout(matrix(c(1,1,2,5,5,6,3,3,4,7,7,8), nrow = 6))

  plot_cov(covs = covs_selected)
  ```

This gives us a general idea of what the potential viruses are.

* Plot (1) indicates that the virus segment infected the sample
* Plot (2) indicates that the virus segment did not infect the sample
* Plot (3) indicates that the peak in the coverage profile could be explained by the mappability profile
* Plot (4) indicates that the peak in the coverage profile could be explained by the increase in the A nucleotide percentage

## Model training

Now, we are going to train the model.

Ideally, the number of the samples used to train the model should be bigger than
100. However, since we are only providing a tutorial on how to use the 
`train_iimi` function, only one sample is used to train the model. 

First, we need to prepare our training data:

```{r}
train_x = df[df$sample_id == "16GVP045_1",]
train_y = detection_segment[train_x$seg_id, "16GVP045_1"]
```

Then, we plug in the variables into the `train_iimi` function with the default
XGBoost model:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
fit <- train_iimi(train_x = train_x, train_y = train_y)
```

Now, we have a trained model using the toy data.

## Model testing

To do the detection, use the sample(s) that you wish to detect as the input.

```{r}
test_x = df[df$sample_id == "22SP009_S6_1",]
test_y = detection_segment[test_x$seg_id, "22SP009_S6_1"]
```

After preparing your test sample, you can choose to test the data using our
provided training model or the model you trained using `train_iimi()`.

If you wish to use your own model:

```{r}
prediction_customized <- predict_iimi(newdata = test_x, method = "xgb", trained_model = fit)
```

If you wish to use provided training model:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
prediction_default <- predict_iimi(newdata = test_x, method = "xgb")
```

The detection of your plant sample(s) is finished. The following shows the prediction for the test sample(s) at the virus level. `TRUE` if virus infected the sample, `FALSE` if virus did not infect the sample.

```{r}
head(prediction_default)
```

**Note: if you would like to see the prediction in the virus segment level, add the parameter `report_result_level = 1`.**
