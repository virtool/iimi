  If you are loading a serialized model (like pickle in Python, RDS in R) generated by
  older XGBoost, please export the model by calling `Booster.save_model` from that version
  first, then load it back in current version. See:

    https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/saving_model.html

  for more details about differences between saving model and serializing.
